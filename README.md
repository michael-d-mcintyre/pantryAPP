# pantryAPP

This is the initial test documents for pantry APP. There will be three files uploaded, one for each sprint. In the first sprint, 2 issues were resolved while several remained unstarted. During the second sprint, every issue had testing done but 3 remained unresolved. The apps stability had an uncommonly large number of issues so it was scheduled for more testing. The third spint finished up the remaining issues. 

Each report displays which issues were completed during which weekly sprint.
